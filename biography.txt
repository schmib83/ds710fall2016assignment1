Your first assignment is to use GitHub to submit some autobiographical information about yourself.  Answer the following questions.  Use GitHub to submit the resulting text file.
1. My Name is Ben Schmirler.
2. I am interested in data science because I have always had a curiosity for exploring data.  I am fascinated by the amount of value corporations and academia can get out of data.  I am especially interested in learning prescriptive analytics and their algorithms.
3. I graduated at UW Oshkosh with a bachelor’s in computer science.  I have taken java, C++, C#, assembly and machine learning, python, perl, the web stack, and database languages.  I also use programming on the job as a database analyst.  I use TSQL often and write reports using SSRS and integration packages using SSIS.
4.  I have taken AP statistics, a calculus based statistics in college, and DS 705. I do not use statistics on the job very often.
5.  I used python in a computer networking course in my undergraduate studies.  I used R in DS700 and DS705 as well as using R as an undergraduate research assistant in the biology department.  
6.  I hope to learn how to integrate R and python in order to solve interesting problems within the theatre of data science.
7.  In my spare time, I like to work out, run, go wine tasting, and hang out with friends.
